# Scope
  This Wiki coveres only a limited subset of ISO20022. Its idea is to provide explanation only for the Message Definitions and Message Responses (MDs&MRs) that you would need to get started with making and handling patments.
These (MDs&MRs) are parts of the 'pain - Payments Initiation' and 'camt - Cash Management' subsections of ISO20022.

  The following is the full list of formats described:
