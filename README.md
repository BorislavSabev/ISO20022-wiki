# ISO20022_php_wiki
An open source wiki for the ISO20022 standard and how to use it (mainly) with PHP. The general information outlined here is standard-specific and thus can be used with any language.

## Goal and purpose
  The purpose of this wiki is to provide information about the ISO20022 financial messaging standard, the Universal financial industry message scheme (UNIFI) and its use (mainly) with PHP. 
  The goal of this repository is to provide:
- an open source resource pool of information about ISO20022
- a list of PHP libraries that support it and information of their status
- a list of external resources on the topic
- host the source to the docs and generate a website from it

  **This is currently a work in progress so bare with me. Also please submit any missing information as PRs if you have it.**
